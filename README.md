This module adds 1 post category: 'Prayer'<br>
You should add a new post with the prayer category each month.
This post should have a prayer request for each day on seperate lines.<br>
The lines should have this format: '1(T) – '<br>
So an example will look like this:<br>
<code>
    1(M) – Prayer for day 1<br>
    2(T) – Prayer for day 2
</code>
<br>
<br>
If such a post is available the daily prayerrequest will be displayed on the homepage and will be available via the rest-api.<br>
